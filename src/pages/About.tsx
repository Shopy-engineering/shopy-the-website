                <p>
                  Shopy was founded in 2024 by Ssempijja Charles, who saw from his sister's business
                  how small businesses were underserved by existing
                  platforms that were either too complex, too expensive, or both.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Drawing on this  experience, he set out to build an
                  e-commerce platform specifically designed for small businesses â€“
                  one that was powerful enough to compete with larger retailers,
                  but simple enough for anyone to use.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, our team  continues to build
                  and improve our platform with one goal in mind: making
                  e-commerce accessible and effective for small businesses
                  everywhere.
